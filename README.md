# HeartAttackPrediction-EDA

🚀 Title

Heart Attack Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis.


📌 Overview

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis to predict the heart attack trends in the dataset, followed by getting the insights from the graphical plots.
The main purpose of building such a project is to learn how we can analyse the given dataset to get some key insights out for the same by ourselves in comparatively easier way of data analysis. EDA makes the analysis better even for someone new to this field and by making out few insights by the trends we plot in the analysis part.
The problem it solves is the assumed insights, which certain factors we assume would give us key insights about the data turns out to be the contrary, even though it could be due to the incomplete data we get from the dataset. 
By doing such data analysis gives a certain kind of motivation to the users where they could perform the same on their own and develop a great skill by this field. Furthermore, this strengthens the core infrastructure for creating machine learning models or be a data scientist in the future.


🛠 Tech Stack

- Language: Python.

- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

- Tools: Jupyter Notebook in VS Code.

- Version Control: Git, GitHub.


📂 Dataset

- Source: The dataset is attached in the same repository.

- Shape: 1001 Rows × 9 Columns

- Description: This dataset contains those essential data which were extracted from individual patients’ test reports.
  

Data such as :- 

•	Gender

•	Age

•	Blood Pressure 

•	Cholesterol

•	Diabetes status 

•	Smoking status 

•	Type of Chest pain 

•	Treatment to undergo 

•	Heart Attack status


⚙️ Steps Performed


1. Missing Data Handling– Imputed missing values for object & numeric data types (if any).

2. Outlier Treatment – Used IQR and Z-score methods (if any).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Categorical or univariate analysis, Numerical analysis, Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends.

-	As there were no missing values & significant outliers in the dataset, I proceeded with the EDA of the dataset. 

📊 Conclusion

- There were Expected & Surprising insights made throughout the analysis.
